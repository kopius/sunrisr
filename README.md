# Sunrisr

There are a ton of websites out there that offer lists of positive, uplifting affirmation statements that you can browse through for inspiration.

There are even a few apps that, via scheduled notifications, will regularly remind you of your favorite affirmations.

I love browsing through sites like these. They fill me with inspiration. But when I went looking for one particular feature, one that's critical for anyone seeking self-improvement, I found that every site lacked it.

There's no interaction. None of affirmation sites I've come across make you _do_ anything.

An inspiring message, flashed across the screen, can give you the momentary boost you need. But people aren't very good at retaining things by just reading them. If you want a message to really sink in, you need to engage with it in some way.

That's why I built Sunrisr: the only app that lets you customize a list of personal affirmations, then prompts you to *write them out every morning.*
