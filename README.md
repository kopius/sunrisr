# Sunrisr

There are a ton of websites out there that offer lists of positive, uplifting affirmation statements that you can browse through for inspiration.

There are even a few apps that, via scheduled notifications, will regularly remind you of your favorite affirmations.

These affirmation tools, while useful, are all lacking one critical feature that's essential for anyone seeking self-improvement:

_They don't make you **do** *anything._

An inspiring message, flashed across the screen, might give you the momentary boost you need. But humans aren't very good at retaining things by just reading them. If you want a message to really sink in, you need to interact with it in some way.

This is why I built Sunrisr: the only app that lets you write a personalized list of daily affirmations, then prompts you to *write them out every morning.*
